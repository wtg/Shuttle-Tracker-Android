    <!-- Explanations-->
    <string name="info_intro">
        Shuttle Tracker shows you the real-time locations of the RPI campus shuttles,
        powered by crowd-sourced location data.\n\nThe map is automatically refreshed every 5 seconds.
        Green buses have high-quality location data,
        and red buses have low-quality location data. In colorblind mode, the green buses
        are replaced by buses with an aqua target/scope icon, and the red buses are replaced by
        a purple dial icon. When boarding a bus, tap \"Board Bus\", and when getting off,
        tap \"Leave Bus\". You must be within 20 meters of a stop by default to board a bus.
    </string>

    <string name="privacy">
        Shuttle Tracker sends your location data to our server only when Board Bus is activated and
        stops sending these data when Board Bus is deactivated. You can activate Board Bus manually
        by tapping “Board Bus” or automatically by positioning your device within Bluetooth range of
        a Shuttle Tracker Node device on a bus if you opted in to the Shuttle Tracker Network. You
        can deactivate Board Bus manually by tapping “Leave Bus” or automatically by positioning
        your device out of Bluetooth range of a Shuttle Tracker Node device on a bus if you opted in
        to the Shuttle Tracker Network. Your location data are associated with an anonymous, random
        identifier that rotates every time you start a new shuttle trip. These data aren’t associated
        with your name, Apple ID, RCS ID, RIN, or any other information that might identify you or
        your device. We continuously purge location data that are more than 30 seconds old from our
        server. We may retain resolved location data that are calculated using a combination of
        system- and user-reported data indefinitely, but these resolved data don’t correspond with
        any specific user-reported coordinates. Even if you opt in to the Shuttle Tracker Network,
        we never track your location unless you manually activate Board Bus or physically board a bus.
        The results of these scans never leave your device, and we only start collecting location
        data if a scan indicates that you’re physically on a bus.
    </string>

    <string name="analytics_policy">
    If you opt in to analytics, then Shuttle Tracker will send anonymous usage data to our server.
    These data include your app settings, feature usage frequency, and other similar metrics.
    No analytics data are ever collected unless you explicitly opt in. You can see a record of
    recently uploaded analytics reports or opt-in status in Settings > Analytics.
